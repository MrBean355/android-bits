# Android Bits

This repository contains the source code from my [Android Bits](https://www.youtube.com/user/355MrBean/videos) YouTube videos.

The bits we have so far:
- [`ListAdapter`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnD1JYfyIE) : `RecyclerView.Adapter` base class for presenting List data in a `RecyclerView`, including computing diffs between Lists on a background thread.
